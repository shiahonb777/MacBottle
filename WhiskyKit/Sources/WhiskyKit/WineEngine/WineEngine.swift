// MARK: - WineEngine

/// The Wine flavour that MacBottle uses at runtime.
///
/// Different flavours (CrossOver-derived, pure upstream Wine, Apple GPTK)
/// differ in where their binaries live on disk, how they are installed or
/// updated, and what licence terms apply to redistributing them. The
/// `WineEngine` protocol captures only the minimum surface the rest of
/// MacBottle needs; concrete engines can add their own capabilities
/// without leaking into callers.
///
/// Engines are intentionally stateless from the app's point of view: all
/// state (installed version, disk paths) is computed from the engine's
/// `libraryRoot` on demand. This keeps substitution easy and makes unit
/// testing trivial — a fake engine pointing at a temp directory is enough.
public protocol WineEngine: Sendable {
    /// Stable machine identifier for this engine flavour. Used as a disk
    /// segment under `Application Support/<bundleID>/Engines/<identifier>/`
    /// so multiple flavours can coexist without clobbering each other.
