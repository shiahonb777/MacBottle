/// `Recipes/<platform>/<id>.json`. At build time they are copied into the
/// bundle by SwiftPM's resource processing. At runtime we walk the bundle's
/// `Recipes` directory and decode every `.json` file we find.
///
/// The loader is intentionally strict: a malformed recipe is logged and
/// skipped, but never silently accepted with incomplete data. CI catches
/// malformed recipes in PR review; this runtime check is a second line of
/// defense for end users.
///
/// Results are cached in memory on first access because recipes ship with
/// the app and never change at runtime. The cache is per-`RecipeStore`
/// instance to keep tests hermetic.
