// MARK: - Recipe

/// A recipe describes how to run a specific Windows game on macOS via a bottle.
///
/// Recipes are authored as JSON files under `WhiskyKit/Sources/WhiskyKit/Recipes/`
/// and shipped inside the WhiskyKit bundle as embedded resources. See
/// `docs/RECIPE_AUTHORING.md` for the contribution workflow and
/// `docs/recipe.v1.schema.json` for the machine-readable schema.
///
/// The `Recipe` type is intentionally flat and append-only: new optional
/// fields may be added, existing fields are never renamed or removed. The
/// `schema` field identifies the contract version.

    /// - `steam.2050650`   — Black Myth: Wukong on Steam
    /// - `gog.1207658924`  — The Witcher 3 on GOG
    /// - `generic.skyrim-se` — installer-based or out-of-platform title

    /// square, under 200 KB recommended). Rendered in the program settings
    /// UI. When missing the UI falls back to a neutral SF Symbol glyph.
    ///
    /// For Steam titles, conventional sources are
    /// `https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/<appid>/header.jpg`
    /// or `.../library_600x900.jpg`. Recipe authors are free to host the
